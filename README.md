# wet-ass plants

schedule/control a drip-irrigation system â€“ the code effectively just turns on/off a gpio pin (so you can probably do other simple things with it)

## code

#### setup

* get an rpi and [set it up](https://gist.github.com/kitallis/7b5ba8ffb9045bd3dce6cd710e00f26a)
* install [crontab-ui](https://github.com/alseambusher/crontab-ui) on it
* download the WAP binary 
* configure it to be [scheduled](http://www.fao.org/3/s8684e/s8684e07.htm) using crontab-ui

## plumbing (literally)

#### drip irrigation kit

I got a kit like [this](https://www.amazon.in/CINAGRO-Irrigation-Garden-Watering-Plants/dp/B07GMVDTH1) that has a main 2/3" hose that you can further extend to a smaller hose that feeds into individual plants; instructions to chop and slice are fairly self-explanatory.

#### additional plumbing

#### water

I don't have an active tap in any of my balconies that house the plants, so I hung a water canister like this with at least 3-4L of stored water to provide enough downward pressure to reach all plants.
